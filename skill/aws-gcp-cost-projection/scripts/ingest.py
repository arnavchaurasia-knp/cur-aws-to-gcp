ingest.py — Phase 1. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: EXTRACTION.

Turn any supported bill format into a faithful, normalized catalog of line
items. This is the extraction layer; it does not resolve canonical identity,
classify charge-type, or map to GCP.

OWNS (its whole job):
  1. Format detection + loading — CSV/TSV (+gz/zst), Parquet, JSON, Excel, PDF,
     ZIP; agy fallback (normalized_bill.csv) for unrecognized shapes.
  2. Dedup into aws_li_catalog — one row per distinct line-item type, stable
     aws_li_key (md5 of the dedup tuple).
  3. Faithful field extraction — product, product_code (raw CUR
     lineItem/ProductCode), usage_type, operation, region->gcp_region,
     pricing_model, line_item_type, is_workload, total_usage, cost,
     license/OS/engine/deployment/volume, pricing_unit, billing_format.
  4. Structured enrichment derivable from the row — instance_type, vcpus,
     ram_gb, arch, instance_count, billing_days, effective_unit_rate.
  5. Bill integrity — PDF total reconciliation, materiality filter.

OUTPUT GUARANTEE: a fully-populated aws_li_catalog carrying the raw facts +
product_code (when the format has one) + structured fields where derivable.
It promises identity RAW MATERIAL (product/product_code), not RESOLVED identity.

EXPLICITLY NOT ingest's job (owned by later layers, keep them out of here):
  - canonical_service resolution   -> aws_normalizer.py / resolve_unknown_product_codes.py
  - mechanic_group (charge-type)   -> classify_mechanics.py
  - any SKU / GCP pricing decision  -> apply_static_mappings.py / family_mapper.py

(The only identity call here is _canonical_service(), used solely as a PDF
section-header parsing heuristic — an extraction aid, not catalog identity.)

# that happens to structurally match "for <hyphenated-token> in <region>"
# just as well as a real marketplace vendor name does — hyphen-or-CamelCase
# alone can't tell them apart. Confirmed real, twice, with two DIFFERENT
# AWS abbreviations (EC2, then AMR): each time an Inspector/WAF row matched
# this regex, its already-correct cur_service ("Amazon Inspector"/"AWS
# WAF") got overwritten with the bogus product name, which then failed
# every downstream service-specific detection and fell through to
# marketplace_thirdparty passthrough — losing the real mapping (SCC
# Premium, Cloud Armor Bot Control) entirely.
#
# A hand-listed prefix exclusion (EC2-, ECR-, ...) is exactly the kind of
# vendor list this whole function was designed to avoid needing — it just
# missed AMR- the first time, and will keep missing the next AWS
# abbreviation (WAF, ACM, NAT, ...) the same way. The real structural tell:
# AWS's own internal resource-type abbreviations are short (2-5 letters),
# ALL-CAPS, acronym-shaped tokens (EC2, ECR, AMR, WAF, ACM) — a genuine
# third-party vendor/product name is never spelled that way (KiroEnterprise,
# DataDogAPM, Some-Vendor-Pro all mix case within the token). Excluding an
# ALL-CAPS shape generically covers every AWS abbreviation without
# hand-listing them one at a time.
#
# Checked against EVERY hyphen-separated segment, not just the first one —
# confirmed real: "Global-AMR-AntiDDoS" (AWS WAF's flat monthly Anti-DDoS
# fee) has the abbreviation ("AMR") in the MIDDLE segment, with an ordinary
# mixed-case word ("Global") first. A first-segment-only check let this one
# through the exact same false-positive path as EC2-Scanning and
# AMR-BotControl-Targeted-Request before it — same root cause, just shifted
# one position over, which is exactly why checking only the first segment
# was never going to generalize.
