outlier_gate.py <projection.duckdb>

Deterministic safety net: clamp any implausible cost blowup rows to passthrough
(GCP = AWS) so the report always generates. Catches the class of bug where a
single mis-mapped SKU (e.g. CloudTrail's 790,600 events wrongly mapped to Cloud
Storage) inflates the total — Bill3 shipped $2.77 -> $38,247 for exactly this
reason.

Rules (a row must have real cost to count):
  R1 single-row ratio : gcp > 50x aws  AND gcp > $100
  R2 single-row abs   : gcp > $10,000  AND aws < $100
  R3 wrong-service    : gcp_service = 'Cloud Storage' but the AWS product is NOT
                        a storage service (S3/Glacier). Non-storage services must
                        never fall back to Cloud Storage.
  R4 whole-bill       : SUM(gcp) > 2 x SUM(aws)

On any violation: write outlier_violations.md (rows named), clamp the bad rows
to AWS-cost passthrough, and exit 0 so the orchestrator continues to report
generation. The report will show clamped rows marked as passthrough. Never
exit 1 — a report with clamped rows is always better than no report.
