service_classifier.py <projection.duckdb>

The Service Classification Engine. Applies the curated data/service_map.json
(AWS-service -> category -> GCP-service) to every mapped row so the GCP target is
DETERMINISTIC instead of a per-row LLM guess. This is what eliminates variance
like "QuickSight -> Looker on one row, -> Cloud Storage on another".

Per matched rule:
  - mode 'review' : force gcp_service = target, strategy = 'passthrough'
                    (carry AWS cost — an honest baseline, never an invented GCP
                    figure), clear the SKU, set confidence, stamp the reason.
                    Used for services whose correct GCP target is known but whose
                    precise GCP pricing still needs per-service modelling.
                    NEVER applied to a row already in a DETERMINISTIC_GROUPS
                    mechanic_group (see below) — those come from a dedicated
                    static mapper in apply_static_mappings.py, never the LLM, so
                    forcing passthrough over them would silently discard a real,
                    resolved SKU-based price. Such a row is left completely
                    untouched (not even 'keep'-stamped — the rule's confidence/
                    reason describe the AWS product in general, which may be a
                    different, more uncertain sub-charge than the one the static
                    mapper actually priced). It still applies to 'misc' rows
                    even when the LLM already set strategy='map' — that's the
                    intentional anti-hallucination backstop (a rule like this one
                    can mean "the LLM's target/SKU for this service can't be
                    trusted yet", which a mechanic_group alone can't tell apart
                    from "this row was priced by a real, reviewed static mapper").
  - mode 'keep'   : the pipeline already prices this well — only STAMP metadata
                    (category + reason), never touch pricing or the mapped SKU.
                    Safe for every row regardless of mechanic_group.

Rich metadata is written to projection_note as:
  "[<category>] <reason> (rule=service_map_v1, gcp=<target>)"

Idempotent, never fatal. Runs post-merge, before fix_storage_misroute (which is
the generic backstop for anything not in the map).
