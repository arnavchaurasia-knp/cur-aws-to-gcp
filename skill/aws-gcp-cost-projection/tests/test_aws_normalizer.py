"""
Layer 1 (aws_normalizer.py) and service_classifier.py regression tests.

Real AWS CUR bills commonly give the `product` field as the compact
concatenated form ("AmazonSES", "AmazonSNS", ...) rather than the spelled-out
name ("Amazon Simple Email Service"). Both canonical_service() and
service_classifier._norm() used to require a literal space after the
"Amazon"/"AWS" prefix before stripping it, which silently failed to
normalize every short-code compact-form product name — confirmed on a real
bill where "AmazonSES" (product field, verbatim) resolved to no canonical
service at all, so its $1,789 charge fell through the SES service_map rule
into the generic "no GCP equivalent found" bucket instead.
