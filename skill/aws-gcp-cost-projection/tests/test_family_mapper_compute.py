"""
Regression guard for family_mapper.py's map_gce_row() — the single highest-
traffic mapper (handles the bulk of ordinary EC2 fleet: m5/c5/r5/t3/etc.),
per its own docstring.

A real bug shipped and went undetected by the rest of the suite: an edit that
moved the `burst_note` computation to after the family-switch logic deleted
the assignment but never re-added it, leaving `burst_note` referenced-but-
undefined in the f-string at the end of map_gce_row(). This raised a bare
NameError for EVERY call — i.e. every non-ARM, non-Windows EC2 compute row.

Because family_mapper.py runs as a soft ('?') PreLLMScript in the pipeline,
this didn't fail the job — it silently meant family_mapper.py produced zero
mappings and pruned zero rows from the Phase 2 manifest for the entire
compute_breakdown group, so every compute row (GPU included) fell through to
the Phase 2 LLM sub-agent unresolved. That sub-agent has no GPU-aware
guidance of its own (it's designed to only confirm SKUs family_mapper.py
already picked), so a GPU row (g5.2xlarge) got mapped to a generic guess
(N4D) instead of the correct GPU-paired family (G2) — a real, customer-
visible mapping error traced back to this crash.

These tests call map_gce_row() directly with real instance types (no DuckDB,
no live catalog/API — resolve_sku is patched) so a regression like this
fails a one-line assertion instead of requiring a live job's family_mapper.py
stderr to be read by hand.
