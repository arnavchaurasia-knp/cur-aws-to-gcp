tests/test_no_shared_data_writes.py — Enforce that per-job scripts never write
to the shared skill/data/ directory.

Background:
Jobs running concurrently (or across ephemeral container deploys) must never
mutate shared state in the skill/data directory. Shared writes cause data loss,
empty-read race conditions, and do not persist on ephemeral container disks.

Permitted writers are strictly pinned to maintenance tools that run offline
or during image build, never per job.
