"""
Guards against the cache-drift bug found via a live customer job: resolve_sku()
trusts a HIT in data/resolved_skus.json forever, with no re-verification against
the current matching logic in lookup_sku_in_catalog() (noise-qualifier filtering,
region-match rules, etc.). When that logic is fixed or tightened, entries cached
under the OLD logic don't automatically get corrected — they just keep returning
the old, now-wrong SKU on every future job, silently, until someone happens to
notice a suspicious cost ratio and investigates by hand.

Confirmed real: two entries in resolved_skus.json ("Hyperdisk Balanced IOPS" for
asia-south1 and asia-south2) were still pointing at "...Confidential Mode" SKU
variants (5-6x cheaper) that the current _has_noise() qualifier filter would
now correctly exclude — the cache was written before that filter existed (or
before it covered "confidential mode") and was never revalidated.

This test is the fix: it re-runs lookup_sku_in_catalog() fresh for every cached
entry and asserts the result still agrees with what's cached. Run this after
ANY change to lookup_sku_in_catalog()/_has_noise()/_NOISE_QUALIFIERS/region
matching — a failure here means the cache has drifted and needs the same kind
of correction applied to data/resolved_skus.json (see git history for the
Hyperdisk IOPS fix as a template) plus a check of which live jobs it touched.

This does NOT catch the OTHER class of cache problem (a cached SKU that's
completely phantom-unavailable despite matching correctly — see
_KNOWN_PHANTOM_AVAILABILITY and the N4D/asia-south2 case) — that's a
catalog-vs-reality problem no amount of re-running our own matching logic can
detect; it requires a human-confirmed exception, not a freshness check.
